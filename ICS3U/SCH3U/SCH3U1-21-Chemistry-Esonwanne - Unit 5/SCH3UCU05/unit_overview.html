            Unit Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The Gases and Atmospheric Chemistry unit begins with the focus on the importance of air quality and the need to be aware of the delicate balance in sustaining the atmosphere. You will have the opportunity to research the effects of human activities on air quality and make recommendations to minimize these effects. You will explore the unique physical properties of gases as compared to solids and liquids and examine descriptions of the different relationships that exist between pressure, volume, temperature and quantity of gases. You will extend your knowledge of the gas laws into the area of gas stoichiometry. Research assignments, quizzes, lab assignments and the unit test will provide you with an opportunity to master the concepts in this unit and prepare you for a continuation of these concepts in the next chemistry course.</p>

                <strong>Overall Expectations:</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>SIV.01</strong> demonstrate scientific investigation skills  (related to both inquiry and research) in the four areas of skills (initiating  and planning, performing and recording, analysing and interpreting, and  communicating);<br>
              <strong>GAV.02</strong> investigate gas laws  that explain the behaviour of gases, and solve related problems; <br>
              <strong>GAV.03</strong> demonstrate an  understanding of the laws that explain the behaviour of gases.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Specific Expectations:</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>SI1.12</strong> use appropriate numeric, symbolic, and  graphic modes of representation, and appropriate units of measurement (e.g., SI  and imperial units);<br>
              <strong>SI1.13</strong> express the results of any  calculations involving data accurately and precisely, to the appropriate number  of decimal places or significant figures;<br>
              <strong>GA2.04</strong> use stoichiometry to  solve problems related to chemical reactions involving gases (e.g., problems  involving moles, number of atoms, number of molecules, mass, and volume);<br>
              <strong>GA2.05</strong> determine, through  inquiry, the molar volume or molar mass of a gas produced by a chemical  reaction (e.g., the molar volume of hydrogen gas from the reaction of magnesium  with hydrochloric acid);<br>
              <strong>GA3.06</strong> explain Avogadro’s hypothesis and how his  contribution to the gas laws has increased our understanding of the chemical  reactions of gases.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Catholic Graduate Expectations:</strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>CGE2b</strong> reads, understands and uses written  materials effectively;<br>
              <strong>CGE2d</strong> writes and speaks  fluently one or both of Canada’s  official languages. </p>

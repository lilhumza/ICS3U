        <p>The reaction between hydrogen gas and  oxygen gas to produce water vapour is a dramatic one. The reaction can be  represented several ways (i.e., number of atoms, molecules, and moles) and  because gases are involved in the reactant side and the product side, a new  aspect can be introduced into an understanding of how gases behave. This  chemical reaction can be represented in the following ways:</p>

        <h4>
          <strong>The  Law of Combining Volumes</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>Joseph Louis <strong>Gay-Lussac</strong> (1778-1823)  proposed the <strong><em>law of combining volumes</em></strong>:  </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <strong>At a given  pressure and temperature, the volumes of reacting gases are in ratios of small  whole numbers.</strong>
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p>Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856) went one step  further. He proposed the following, which is now known as <strong>Avogadro’s  Hypothesis:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Equal volumes  of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of  molecules.</strong>
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p>The extension of Avogadro’s hypothesis led  to Avogadro’s Law regarding the quantitative relationship between the volume of  a gas and the number of moles of the gas when pressure and temperature are kept  constant:</p>

          <strong>Gas  Stoichiometry</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>          Given  conditions of temperature and pressure, quantifying reactions involving a gas  as a reactant, or as a product, involves using gas laws in a stoichiometric  relationship. </p>

          <em>2. Your  second step is to find the number of moles of oxygen gas by comparing the mole  to mole ratio between octane and oxygen gas. Let x represent the number of  moles of oxygen gas needed for the reaction.</em>

        <h4>Gas Mixtures</h4>
        <p>In a mixture of gases where they are not reacting  with each other, their respective partial pressures may be determined by using Dalton’s <strong>law of  partial pressures</strong>:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>The total  pressure of a mixture of gases is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases  that make up the mixture.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you have a mixture of Gas A, Gas B, Gas  C and Gas D in certain proportions, the total pressure of the mixture can be  determined as follows:</p>
        <p align="center">
          <img height="22" width="207" alt="Equation" src="images/image09.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>In general terms, Dalton’s law of partial pressure can be  expressed as:</p>
        <p align="center">
          <img height="21" width="184" alt="Equation" src="images/image10.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Each gas that makes up a physical mixture  is considered to have its own pressure within that mixture. </p>
        <p>In general terms, the air in our lungs is  composed of a mixture of water vapour and dry air. At the normal 101.3 kPa of  atmospheric pressure, the air pressure is due to the pressure of dry air and  vapour pressure of water. The total pressure expression is as follows:</p>
        <p align="center">
          <img height="22" width="246" alt="Equation" src="images/image11.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>Normal body temperature is 37°C. The  vapour pressure of water at that temperature is 47.07 mmHg. The conversion to  kilopascals is as follows:</p>

          <p>There is a direct relationship between  volume and the change in mass of an ideal gas. This relationship is expressed as  V<strong><img src="images/image007.gif" alt="proportionality sign" width="12" height="12"></strong> n. Keeping pressure and temperature constant, a change in mass  directly affects the change in volume.</p>

          <p>Graphically, the relationship is as  follows:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image015.gif" alt="A Graph" width="119" height="126"></p>

          <h4><strong>Ideal Gas Law</strong></h4>

          <p>            Up to this point in Activity 2, we have  explored the relationships involving moles, volume, pressure and temperature of  an ideal gas. The proportional relationships are as follows:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image016.gif" alt="Proportional Relationships " width="500" height="135"></p>

          <p>Real gases are different from ideal gases. It  is important to note that these relationships describe ideal gases. We assume that  there are no forces of attraction between molecules of gas in a real world. However,  any deviation from these relationships for ideal gases occurs at high pressures,  which force the gaseous molecules closer together. Gases will deviate from the  ideal behaviour at low temperatures when the gas is close to changing into the  liquid state. 

The combination of all three laws, using  the proportionality sign, produces the following expression:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image017.gif" alt="Equation" width="66" height="82"></p>

          <p>Again, to change the proportionality sign  into an equals sign, a constant needs to be introduced into the expression. It  now looks like the following:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image018.gif" alt="Equation" width="93" height="63"></p>

          <p>A more familiar version of this formula is:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image019.gif" alt="Equation" width="76" height="19"></p>

          <p>If the mass of the gas is given, then the <strong>n</strong> can be substituted using the mass of the gas and its molecular molar mass. Here  is another version:</p>

          <p align="center"><img src="images/image020.gif" alt="Equation" width="83" height="37"></p>

          <p>The <em>R </em>is called the gas constant and  its value is based on <strong>standard temperature and pressure</strong> (<strong>STP</strong>). To  keep consistency in the scientific community regarding calculations with the  ideal gas law, it has been decided that physical data, concerning gases, correlates  with an agreed upon value of standard temperature and pressure. Standard  temperature is O°C  (273 K) and standard pressure is101.3 kPa. The numerical value of <em>R</em> varies with the units of the other variables. Here is a  list of the different values:</p>

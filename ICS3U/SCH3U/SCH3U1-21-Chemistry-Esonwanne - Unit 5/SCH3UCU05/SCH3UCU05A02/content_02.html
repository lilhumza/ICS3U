        <p>In summary, the <strong>Kinetic Molecular Theory</strong> for moving molecules of ideal gases is as follows:</p>

		

		<ol start="1">

		<li>Gases  are made up of a large number of molecules which move in a continuous and  random motion. <br>

          Note:   The molecule is considered to be the smallest part of a gas. In the case of  a noble gas, the smallest particle is an atom.</li>

		  

		  

        <li>The  combined total volume of all the molecules of gas is negligible compared to the  volume which it occupies.</li>

		

        <li>The  forces of attraction and repulsion between molecules of a gas are negligible.</li>

		

        <li>The  collisions of gas molecules are perfectly elastic. There is a transfer of  energy at the collision, but the maintenance of a constant temperature ensures  their continued motion.</li>

		

        <li>The  average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is directly dependent on  temperature.</li></ol>

		

        <h4><strong>Behaviour of Gases and Gas Laws</strong></h4>

        <p>

        The quantitative perspective describing the behaviour of gases  involves the following physical properties and their respective symbols and  units:</p>

            <p>              P = pressure of the gas, measured in Pascals (Pa) or kilopascals  (kPa) in the metric system and psi in the imperial system</p>

            <p>              V = volume of the gas, measured in litres (L) or m<span class="superscript">3</span></p>

            <p>              T = temperature of the gas, measured in Kelvins (T (K) = T (°C +  273.15)</p>

            <p>

        n = amount of gas measured in moles (mol)</p>

      <p>In the interactive model showing the  relationship between volume and pressure, the line of the graph indicates an  indirect relationship- <strong>V </strong><strong><img src="images/image007.gif" alt="proportionality sign" width="12" height="12"> 1/P</strong>.</p>

        <p>          Graphically, the relationships look like  the following:</p>

        <table width="65%" border="0" cellpadding="2">

          <tr>

            <td><img src="images/image004.gif" alt="A Graph" width="97" height="102"></td>

            <td><img src="images/image005.gif" alt="A Graph" width="97" height="102"></td>

          </tr>

        </table>

        <p>The graph for V = 1/P is as follows:</p>

        <table width="65%" border="0" cellpadding="2">

          <tr>

            <td><div align="center"><img src="images/image010.gif" alt="A Graph" width="109" height="105"></div></td>

          </tr>

        </table>

        <p>Boyle’s law states that at a constant  temperature, the volume of a fixed mass of a gas is inversely proportional to  its pressure. In other words, when volume increases, the pressure will decrease.</p>

        <p>The relationship, <strong>V <img src="images/image007.gif" alt="proportionality sign" width="12" height="12"></strong><strong> 1/P</strong>, can be turned into an equation by  introducing a constant, thereby changing the proportionality sign,<strong><img src="images/image007.gif" alt="proportionality sign" width="12" height="12"></strong>, into an equals sign. The result  is <strong>V = K/P</strong>. Rearranging this equation, it can be shown as <strong>PV = K</strong>. </p>

        <p>          When  temperature and the mass of the gas are fixed, the equation can be used to  calculate a new pressure or volume when there are changes to the pressure and  volume. The transfer of a gas from one tank to another, with a different volume  and pressure, is an example where you would use the following:</p>

        <p align="center"><strong>P<span class="subscript">1</span>V<span class="subscript">1</span>  = P<span class="subscript">2</span>V<span class="subscript">2</span></strong></p>

        <h4><img class="icon" src="images/example.gif" alt="Example Icon" /> Example</h4>

<p>If 4.0 L of nitrogen gas has a pressure of  200 kPa and the pressure is decreased to 140 kPa, what is the final volume of  the gas?</p>

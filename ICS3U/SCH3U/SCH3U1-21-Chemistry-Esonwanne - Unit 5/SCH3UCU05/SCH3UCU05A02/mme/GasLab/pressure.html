<P>An important <A HREF="airprop.html">property</A> of any gas
is its pressure. We have some experience with air
pressure that we don't have with properties like viscosity
and compressibility. We've heard meteorologists give the daily
value of the barometric pressure of the atmosphere (29.8 inches of
mercury, for example). And most of us have blown up a balloon or used
a pump to inflate a bicycle tire or a basketball.</P>

<P>Because understanding what pressure is and how it works is so
fundamental to the understanding of aerodynamics, we are including
several slides on air pressure in the Beginner's Guide. An
interactive simulator allows you to study
how the atmospheric pressure changes with altitude.</P>

<P><B><U>Definition of Pressure</U></B></P>

<P>There are two ways to look at pressure: (1) the small scale action
of individual air molecules or (2) the large scale action of a large
number of molecules. Starting with the small scale action, from the
<A HREF="kinth.html">kinetic theory</A> of gases, a gas is composed
of a large number of molecules that are very small relative to the
distance between molecules. The molecules are in constant, random
motion and frequently collide with each other and with the walls of
any container. The molecules possess the physical properties of mass,
momentum, and energy. As the gas molecules collide with the walls of
a container, as shown on the left of the figure, the molecules impart
momentum to the walls, producing a force <b>perpendicular</b> to the wall.
The sum of the forces of all the molecules striking the wall divided by the area of the
wall is defined to be the <B>pressure</B>. The pressure of a gas is
then a measure of the linear momentum of the molecules of a gas.
The pressure acts perpendicular (normal) to the wall; the tangential (shear)
component of the force is related to the viscosity of the gas.

<P><B><U>Scalar Quantity</U></B></P>

<P>Let us look at a gas that does not appear to move or flow.
Actually, while the gas does not appear to move, the individual
molecules of the gas (which we cannot see) are in constant random
motion. Because we are dealing with a large number of molecules
(nearly infinite) and because the motion of the individual molecules
is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we
enclose the gas within a container, we will detect a pressure in the
gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We
can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the
<B>force per area</B> (the pressure) will be the same. (If the gas as
a whole were moving, the measured pressure would be different in the
direction of the motion, as described by Bernoulli's
equation.) We could shrink the size of our "container" down to
an infinitely small point, and the pressure would have a single value
at that point. Therefore, pressure is a <B>scalar</B> quantity, not a
vector quantity. It has a magnitude but no direction associated with
it. Pressure acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the
surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular to the
surface.</P>

<P><B><U>Magnitude of Pressure Force</U></B></P>

<P>Turning to the larger scale, the magnitude of the pressure force
is equal to the pressure (force/area) times the surface area, and the
direction is perpendicular to the surface. (You can explore the
effects of pressure on other gas variables at the animated <A HREF="frglab.html">gas
lab).</A> In the figure shown above on the right, we have a gas (in
red) that is confined in a box. A force is applied to the top of the
box. The pressure force within the box opposes the applied force. And
the pressure equals the external force divided by the area of the top
of the box. Inside the gas, the pressure acts in all directions. So
the pressure would also push on the bottom of the box and on the
sides. <B> This is different from simple solid mechanics. </B> If the
red gas were a solid, there would be no forces applied to the sides
of the box; the applied force would be simply transmitted to the
bottom. But in a gas, because the molecules are free to move about
and collide with one another, a force applied in the vertical
direction causes forces in the horizontal direction.</P>

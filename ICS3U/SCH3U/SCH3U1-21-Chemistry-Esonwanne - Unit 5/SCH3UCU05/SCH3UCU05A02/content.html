        <p>At the time of creation, the Earth’s  atmosphere was in concert with the land and water. The natural cycles of water,  carbon and nitrogen, amongst others, were well balanced. Increased human  activities have created an imbalance in the natural state of the Earth. <br>

            <br>

          There are greater amounts and varieties of  substances in the Earth’s atmosphere. But we need many of these gases; their  presence provides a resource. Carbonated drinks need carbon dioxide. Dry ice  used in concerts is really solid carbon dioxide. When you blow up a balloon,  you fill it up with your breath. There are many useful applications for gases  and these applications are dependent on the physical properties and nature of  gases.</p>

        <h4><strong>States of Matter</strong> </h4>

        <p>          The three commonly known states of matter  are solid, liquid and gas.  Each of these states has its own distinct physical properties and its behaviour is a result of these unique properties. The  forces of attraction and repulsion between particles of a substance are the  major drivers of the state of matter. Conditions, such as temperature and  pressure also play important roles in the physical properties of matter as does  the mass and volume of a substance. </p>

          <li>Forces of attraction, between  particles, are weaker than those in the liquid state, but stronger than those  in the gaseous state.</li>

          <li>Particles exhibit vibrational,  rotational and translational movements.</li>

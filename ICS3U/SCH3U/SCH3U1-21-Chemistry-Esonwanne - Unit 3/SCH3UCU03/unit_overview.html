        <p>
            The economics of today’s world as well as the sustainability of the environment and the health of individuals, dictate the necessity of chemists understanding and applying a quantitative component to chemical reactions. You will have the opportunity to investigate the incorporation of quantitative analysis and use with chemical reactions, and on the basis of your faith, critically analyze and assess importance of quantities in chemical reactions. The Quantities in Chemical Reactions unit establishes a critical foundation for you to gain a better understanding and scope of the calculations involved in chemical reactions. You will be able to connect numeracy with chemical reactions by viewing a variety of multimedia video clips.</p>

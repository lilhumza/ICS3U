        <p>In each of the above reactions, magnesium  oxide is produced and the formula in each case is MgO. </p>
        <p>Preparing and analyzing copper carbonate in  many different ways, Joseph Louis Proust, 1754-1826, consistently found that  its composition was always the same. Studying other compounds in a similar  fashion, he was able to determine that their respective compositions were  always the same. He proposed that there be a <strong>Law of Constant Composition. </strong></p>
        <p>John Dalton, 1766-1844, went a step further  and proposed a <strong>Law of Definite  Proportions</strong> in his Atomic Theory. Dalton  included the idea that atoms chemically combined in simple definite numbers to  form compounds. The list of examples is endless.  Water is composed of 2 hydrogen atoms to 1 oxygen  atom. Carbon monoxide is always 1 carbon atom and 1 oxygen atom.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Percentage Composition</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In magnesium oxide, the ratio of atoms  between magnesium and oxygen is 1:1. The mole:mole relationship between  magnesium and oxygen is 1:1. However, on the basis of mass, the ratio is  different in magnesium oxide. The common analysis of a compound to help  determine its composition is its percentage composition. <strong><em>Percentage  composition</em> is the percent by mass of each element in a compound. </strong>The  formula is as follows:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Percent composition of an element = <em><u>n </u></em><u>x molar mass of element</u> x 100%</strong>
          <br />

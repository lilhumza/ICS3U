            <strong>Background</strong>
          </p>
          <p>A common  active ingredient in antiperspirants is aluminum chloride hexahydrate, AlCl<span class="subscript">3</span>&middot;6H<span class="subscript">2</span>O.  It blocks the sweat pores,  so that you won't produce body odour from your  armpits. When such a hydrate is heated,  its anhydrous salt is produced  separately with the water molecules detached. The chemical reaction is as  follows:</p>
          <p align="center">
            <img height="40" width="299" src="images/equation1.gif" />
          </p>
          <p>The  empirical formula of the hydrate may be determined by a comparison of the mole  to mole relationship between the water molecule and the anhydrous salt. Recording  the initial mass of the hydrate and the mass of the anhydrous salt will provide  the necessary data for calculating the coefficient in front of the water  molecule. The percentage composition of water in the hydrate can also be  calculated using the recorded data. </p>

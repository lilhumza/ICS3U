                <strong>Overall Expectations:</strong>

            </p>

            <p><strong>QCV.02</strong> investigate quantitative  relationships in chemical reactions, and solve related problems;<br>

              <strong>QCV.03</strong> demonstrate an  understanding of the mole concept and its significance to the quantitative  analysis of chemical reactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific Expectations:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>QC2.01</strong> use appropriate terminology related to  quantities in chemical reactions, including, but not limited to: <em>stoichiometry</em>, <em>percentage yield</em>, <em>limiting  reagent</em>, <em>mole</em>, and <em>atomic mass</em>;<br>

                <strong>QC2.03</strong> solve problems related to quantities in  chemical reactions by performing calculations involving quantities in moles,  number of particles, and atomic mass; <br><strong>QC2.04</strong> determine the empirical formulae and molecular formulae of various chemical  compounds, given molar masses and percentage composition or mass data;<br>

                <strong>QC2.05</strong> calculate the  corresponding mass, or quantity in moles or molecules, for any given reactant  or product in a balanced chemical equation as well as for any other reactant or  product in the chemical reaction;<br>

                <strong>QC2.06</strong> solve problems related  to quantities in chemical reactions by performing calculations involving  percentage yield and limiting reagents;<br>

                <strong>QC3.01</strong> explain the law of  definite proportions;<br>

                <strong>QC3.02</strong> describe the  relationships between Avogadro’s number, the mole concept, and the molar mass  of any given substance;<br>

                <strong>QC3.03</strong> explain the relationship  between the empirical formula and the molecular formula of a chemical compound;<br>

                <strong>QC30.4</strong> explain the quantitative  relationships expressed in a balanced chemical equation, using appropriate  units of measure (e.g., moles, grams, atoms, ions, molecules).</p>

            <p><strong>Catholic Graduate Expectations:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>CGE2a</strong> develops one's God-given potential and  makes a meaningful contribution to society;<br>

        <p>The coefficients of the balanced chemical equation for the combustion  of acetylene show:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 molecules of acetylene chemically react with 5 molecules  of oxygen gas to produce</li>
          <li>4 molecules of carbon dioxide gas and 2 molecules of water vapour</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chemical reactions happen on a very large  scale compared to the atomic and molecular levels. Laboratories, chemical  processing plants and manufacturing plants rely on the numerical ratios of the coefficients  of the reactants and products to plan for a balanced chemical reaction. The  individual reactants and products and their respective amounts need to be  calculated even before a chemical reaction is designed for use on an industrial  scale. </p>

          <strong>The Mole</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>        Chemists need a translator to convert the  numbers of atoms and molecules that are reacting, and being produced, in a  chemical reaction to more manageable and measurable amounts. This translator is  the International System of Units (SI) unit called the <strong><em>mole</em></strong><strong>(<em>mol</em>)</strong>.  The mole is the number equal to the number of carbon atoms found in exactly 12  g of the carbon-12 isotope. The actual number of carbon-12 atoms found in a  mole has been experimentally found to be 6.022 x 10<span class="superscript">23</span>. This number  is called <strong><em>Avogadro’s number</em></strong><strong>(<em>N<span class="subscript">A</span></em>)</strong> in  honour of the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. </p>
        <p align="center">
          <strong>
            <em>N<span class="subscript">A</span> = </em>6.022 x 10<span class="superscript">23</span></strong>
        </p>
        <p>The SI base unit of the amount of a  substance is the mole (mol) and its symbol in a formula is represented by <em>n</em>.  The quantity of the substance is represented by the symbol N.</p>
        <p>The formula showing the mathematical  relationship between n, N and NA is as follows:</p>
        <p align="center">
          <strong>N  = n x N<span class="subscript">A</span></strong>
        </p>
        <p>If you want to calculate <strong>n</strong>, then you  rearrange the formula to look like this:</p>

            In addition to dissolving polar molecules, water dissolves ionic compounds. The oxygen atom of the water will attract cations (positive ions) and the hydrogen atoms will attract the anions (negative ions).

        <p>Non-polar  molecules have an equal distribution of charges within their respective  molecule and they do not dissolve in water. They are immiscible with water.  Non-polar molecules produce relatively weak intermolecular forces of attraction  and repulsion that are called London  dispersion forces. Even though polar molecules have strong intermolecular  forces of attraction and repulsion, non-polar molecules are not attracted to  the polar molecules. As the saying goes, “Oil and water do not mix.”  On the other hand, non-polar molecules are  miscible with non-polar molecules. <strong>Remember:  “like dissolves like”</strong>.</p>

            <td><p>Higher  temperatures make particles move faster. The lower solubility of gases at  higher temperatures is the result of the gases moving faster and escaping from  the liquid. For solids, it is a different story. The ionic bonds, or the  intermolecular bonds, of molecular solids are broken to a greater degree at  higher temperatures, resulting in a higher solubility.</p>
            <p>Changes in  pressure do not affect the solubility of a solid in a solvent. However,  pressure plays an important role in the solubility of a gas in a liquid. Higher  pressures on a solution will keep the gas dissolved in the liquid. The  solubility is higher. Lower pressures will allow the gas to escape. The  solubility of a gas will therefore be lower. For example, a carbonated drink is  bottled under pressure. Removing the cap will decrease the pressure. In turn, the  solubility of the gas will be decreased and the gas can escape. </p></td>

        <h4><strong>Concentrations  and Calculations</strong></h4>
        <p>The concentration of a solution can be  described either quantitatively or qualitatively. A qualitative description  uses the terms <strong>dilute</strong> or <strong>concentrated</strong>. A dilute solution denotes  a low percentage of a solute in the solution. A concentrated solution indicates  a high percentage of solute in the solution.</p>
        <p>There are  several quantitative expressions of concentration. Three common types are molar  concentration, percent concentration, and parts per million or parts per  billion.</p>
        <h4>Molar Concentration</h4>
        <p>Molar  concentration is a very common concentration calculation in the chemistry  laboratory. Its formula is as follows:<br><br>

            <strong>Chemical  Contaminants in Tested Drinking Water</strong>
          </h4>
          <p>Municipal drinking water is the result of a  series of physical and chemical treatments that allow for human consumption. Common  chemical treatments include chlorination, ozonation and fluoridation. Certain  chemicals are present in drinking water due to treatment or lack of treatment  and despite best efforts to eliminate all contaminants, some substances remain.  Chlorine is present in drinking water where chlorination is used as a part of  the treatment of water. In some cases, a contaminant is present because of  older plumbing procedures. Lead soldering in the piping systems of older homes  and buildings for instance, produces lead in drinking water. Quality control  within the water treatment plant is strictly adhered to ensure that the  contaminants&#39; concentration levels are below government guidelines and  standards. So the water you consume is still a mixture of many invisible  substances. </p>

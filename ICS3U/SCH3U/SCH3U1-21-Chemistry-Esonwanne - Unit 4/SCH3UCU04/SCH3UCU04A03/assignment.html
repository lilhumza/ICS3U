<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>
<p>You are an analytical chemist working in a lab where patience and attention to detail are very important components of the job. One of the analyses that you perform is an acid-base titration. It is a very common and popular chemical procedure that involves a chemical reaction when two solutions are mixed together. By mixing measured amounts and knowing the concentration of one solution, the concentration of another solution is helped by using an indicator to show the desired completion of the reaction. Upon completion of the procedure, a formula is given to you to help you with the calculations.</p>

<p>Follow these instructions as you proceed in setting up the titration</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Select the "Weak Acid vs Strong Base"</li>
<li>Select the "Base" in "2. Fill the Burette with"</li>
<li>Press the "Select the Acid and Base" button and then select "CH<span class="subscript">3</span>COOH" as your acid and "NaOH" as your base.</li>
<li>Select "Phenolphthalein" as your indicator.</li>
</ol>
<p>Attention! Before you proceed with Step 5, the colour that you will be looking out for in the flask when you start adding the sodium hydroxide from the burette to the acetic acid in the flask is pink as shown in the example below.</p>
<p align="center"><img height="20" width="25" alt="Pink Rectangle" src="images/pink_rectangle.gif" /></p>
<p>If the colour of the pink becomes darker, then you have to start again. Be patient, you will just need to click on "Reset" and then start from the beginning.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Start adding the sodium hydroxide solution by pressing on the "Dropwise" button to the right of the Erlenmeyer flask.</li>
<li>If you use the "5. Push Slider Up to Add a Volume of Base" then the sodium hydroxide will pour out faster and you might pass the target colour of the indicator.</li>
<li>Upon reaching the desired colour, record the following information:</li>
</ol>
<p>Name of Acid:</p>
<p>Name of Base:</p>
<p>Name of Indicator:</p>
<p>Molar Concentration (Molarity) of acid, C<span class="subscript">A</span> =</p>
<p>Volume of Acid, V<span class="subscript">A</span> =</p>
<p>Volume of Base (NaOH Total Volume of Base), V<span class="subscript">B</span>=</p>
<p>The calculation to find the concentration of the sodium hydroxide is as follows:</p>
<p><img height="50" width="316" align="absmiddle" alt="equation" src="images/equation.gif" /> = (Use significant figures.)</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Insert your answer into "6. After Titration. Calculate and Enter Molarity of Base" and press "OK"</li>
<li>If you performed the titration with success and you did not make any calculation errors, then a message "Correct" will appear. If you made a mistake, then an "Incorrect" message will appear and you will need to click "Reset" and redo the experiment.</li>

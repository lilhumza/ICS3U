            Acids and Bases</h4>
        <p>Early acid-base theories were based on the  exhibited properties of acids and bases.</p>
        <p>Litmus paper turns red in an acid: <img src="images/red_rectangle.gif" alt="Red Rectangle" width="28" height="40" align="absmiddle"> and blue in a base: <img src="images/blue_rectangle.gif" alt="Blue Rectangle" width="28" height="40" align="absmiddle">. </p>
        <p>In later years, acids and bases were  categorized according to their reactions.<br>
In 1884, Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish  chemist, discovered that a dissolved substance that dissociates into  electrically charged ions in a solution produces an electrolyte. He was awarded  a Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1903 for this work. Aqueous solutions of acids  and bases were found to ionize and conduct electricity and were considered to  be electrolytes.</p>
        <p>According to the <strong>Arrhenius theory of  acids and bases</strong>, the ionization of a substance that produces an H<span class="superscript">+</span>  ion is considered to be an Arrhenius acid. The ionization of a substance that  produces a hydroxide ion, OH<span class="superscript">-</span>,  is considered to be an Arrhenius base. </p>
        <p>The ionization of an Arrhenius acid can be  shown two ways:</p>
        <p><img src="images/solution11.gif" alt="Ionization of an Arrhenius acid and base." width="513" height="147"></p>
        <p>There are substances that are considered to  be acids or bases even though the formula seems to suggest that they are  neutral. Aluminum nitrate, Al(NO<span class="subscript">3</span>)<span class="subscript">3</span> produces an acidic  solution. Ammonia, NH<span class="subscript">3</span>, produces ammonium hydroxide. <br>
Therefore, the revised Arrhenius theory  states that:</p>
        <p>*  an <strong>Arrhenius acid</strong> is a substance which ionizes in water to produce an  increase in hydronium ions; </p>

        <p>After watching the two videoclips, it  appears that hydrochloric acid almost completely (&gt;99%) ionizes in water and  ammonia only partially (&lt;50%) ionizes in water. Hydrochloric acid is  considered to be a <strong>strong acid</strong> along with the following:  hydrobromic acid, HBr; hydroiodic acid, HI;  nitric acid, HNO<span class="subscript">3</span>, perchloric acid, HClO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and sulphuric  acid, H<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>. All other acids are considered to be weak  acids. <strong>Strong bases</strong> include the hydroxides of the alkali metals: LiOH,  NaOH, KOH, RbOH and CsOH. The hydroxides of the alkaline-earth metals:  Mg(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>, Ca(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span> and  Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span> are considered to be strong, too.<br>
Weak acids and bases partially ionize.</p>
        <h4>Neutralization</h4>
          <p>An acidic solution has a pH &lt; 7. An  alkaline solution has pH &gt; 7. A neutral solution has a pH = 7.</p>

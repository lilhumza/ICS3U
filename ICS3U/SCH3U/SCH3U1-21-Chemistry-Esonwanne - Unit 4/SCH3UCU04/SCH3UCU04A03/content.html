        <p>Whenever two solutions mix together and  there is a formation of a precipitate, there will be ions which produce the  precipitate and ions which do not react. 

The ions that do not react, in a  precipitation reaction, are called <strong>spectator ions</strong>. A <strong>net ionic equation</strong> can be determined by recognizing the ions producing the precipitate.</p>

            Example</h4>
        <p>Show the spectator ions and the net ionic  equation of the reaction between the solutions of lead (II) nitrate and  potassium iodide</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(Notice that the spectator ions are found  on the reactant and product side of the equation.)</em>
        </p>
        <p>The  net ionic equation is: <img height="20" width="248" alt="Solution" align="absmiddle" src="images/solution2.gif" /></p>
        <p>Solubility rules are important guidelines that allow you to determine  the formation of a precipitate. Insoluble compounds will produce a precipitate  in an aqueous medium. Take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="solubility_rules.html">solubility rules for ionic  compounds</a>. </p>
        <p>The two solutions that are mixing do not  tell the whole story. These prepared solutions contain predetermined  concentrations. With known concentrations and volumes, a stoichiometric  relationship is established when they mix and react together. The mass of the  precipitate and the concentrations of the ions can be determined in these  precipitation reactions. </p>

		<p>Water is a very unique molecule, one that  all living organisms need to survive. It can be found in the seas, ground and  sky. It travels between and amongst living and nonliving things, taking with it  some interesting “passengers”. </p>
        <p>It is the presence of these passengers that  can make water a harmful substance. Presently, there are concerns regarding  prescription drugs, hormones, pesticides and other uncontrolled substances  being emitted into the environment. Sources of these harmful substances include  both domestic and industrial use and waste. Human activities, over time, have  certainly changed God’s landscape. </p>

        <p>Technology  is available for water and sewage treatments. But, the treatment is dependent  on location and availability of appropriate infrastructure in rural and urban  areas. Waste water from domestic use in rural areas is mostly accomplished through  a septic system. Here, the potential for contaminating the water supply is  great because of the lack of sophisticated equipment. Examine the graphic below  showing a typical septic water treatment situation in a rural area.</p>

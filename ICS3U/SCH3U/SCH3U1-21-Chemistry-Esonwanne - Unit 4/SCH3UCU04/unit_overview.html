            Unit Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>Sustainability of the  aquatic environment dictates the necessity of chemists understanding and  applying a quantitative and conceptual component to the study of solutions and  solubility. In this unit, you will have an opportunity to investigate the tools  and resources available for quantitative analysis of solutions and their  respective concentrations, and on the basis of your faith, critically analyze  and assess importance of identifying and making judgements. The Solutions and  Solubility unit establishes a framework for you to gain a better understanding  and scope of the calculations involved in dilutions, solubility, pH  measurement, stoichiometric relationships in solution chemistry and  concentrations.  Video-clips and  simulations will provide you with complementary tools for a greater  understanding of the concepts. Research assignments, quizzes, lab assignments  and the unit test are opportunities to master the concepts in this unit and  prepare you for a continuation of the concepts in the next chemistry course.</p>

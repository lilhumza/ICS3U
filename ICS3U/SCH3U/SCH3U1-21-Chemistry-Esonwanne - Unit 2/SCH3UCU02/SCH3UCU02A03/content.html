          <strong>Types of Reactions</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>              Chemical reactions exist in a variety of  places: industry, home, work, even within our own bodies, but there is a common  classification of these chemical reactions. The classification of a chemical  reaction is a far-reaching entity. There are complicated chemical reactions  that are exclusive to a particular branch of chemistry and are used in academic  or industrial research. But, the fundamental chemical reactions can be divided  into four categories plus the combustion of hydrocarbons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Combination  (also known as synthesis, addition or combination)</li>
          <li>Decomposition</li>
          <li>Single  Displacement</li>
          <li>Double  Displacement</li>
          <li>Combustion  of Hydrocarbons

                <br /></li>
        </ol>

              <p>The Canadarm2 needed a combination reaction to blast off into space.  That’s right, a combination reaction with a big bang!<br /><br />

The Canadarm relied on the space shuttle  fuel system. The main fuel for the space shuttle consists of liquid hydrogen  and liquid oxygen. The reaction between the two provided the fuel for the  shuttle to blast off into space.</p>
              <p>The reaction is as follows:</p>
              <h4>H<span class="subscript">2</span>  +  O<span class="subscript">2</span>  <img height="12" width="14" src="images/Arrow2_grn.gif" /> H<span class="subscript">2</span>O   +    energy</h4>

        <p>Hydrogen  and oxygen do not necessarily need to be in the liquid states. They can also  react in the gaseous state to produce water.  Witness the reaction’s force in the following  videoclip:</p>

        <p>The video demonstrated what is known as a combination  reaction. If two substances react to produce one new substance, then a  combination reaction is produced.</p>
        <p>A very straightforward  combination/synthesis reaction is when a single compound is produced from its  elemental components.</p>

              <p> Carbonated drinks  rely on a combination reaction. When a pop can is opened, it “fizzes” as the  gas is released from the carbonated drink. During the manufacture of the  carbonated drink, carbon dioxide gas is forced into the water solution and then  mixed together. A reaction occurs to produce a carbonic acid. The release of  the pressure in the can has the opposite effect. The carbonic acid breaks apart  and produces carbon dioxide gas. This leaves that “flat” taste for the drinker.</p>

        <p>A commonly known fact about carbon dioxide  is that its solid state is known as dry ice. Watch the following videoclip  showing the dry ice, CO<span class="subscript">2</span>, being mixed in water. The indicator is  there to show a change in pH levels.</p>

            <p>The translation of a chemical reaction to a presentation involving its constituents, reactant(s) and product(s), is an important step towards a more meaningful comprehension of the phenomenon. The ability to utilize the knowledge of nomenclature and use it to represent a chemical reaction is part of the language of chemistry. The process of achieving a balanced equation involves arithmetic logic. The ability to recognize the particular type of reactions by examining the chemical equation is an important skill in predicting products of the reaction. A chemical reactions assignment and a reactions quiz is part of this activity. Inquiry components in this activity involve metallic oxides and non-metallic oxides’ reactions with water; activity series; neutralization and complete and incomplete combustion reactions.</p>

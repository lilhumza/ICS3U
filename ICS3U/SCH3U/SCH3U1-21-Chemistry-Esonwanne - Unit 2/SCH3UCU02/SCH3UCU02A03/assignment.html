          <p>The purpose of this assignment is to  investigate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the neutralization of an  acid-base reaction; and</li>
            <li>the respective reactions  between a metal oxide, non-metal oxide and water.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Part  A Neutralization of an Acid-Base  Reaction</strong>
          </p>
          <p>A small beaker of hydrochloric acid is  tested with a strip of universal indicator paper before a solution of sodium  hydroxide was added drop wise to the acid. The starting pH of the hydrochloric  acid was 1. At various points between the additions of drops, clean strips of  the universal indicator paper were dipped into the solution and the colours  were recorded and matched to a colour scheme connected to a pH value. The  results are shown below:</p>

          </p>
          <p>Answer the following questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Describe the  trend in the changes in pH values as sodium hydroxide was being added to the  hydrochloric acid.</li>
            <br />
            <li>What are the two  products of a neutralization reaction between the hydrochloric acid and sodium  hydroxide? </li>
            <br />
            <li>For the reaction  between sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric  acid write:</li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>A word chemical equation</li>

              <li> balanced chemical equation. <br /></li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <p>Extension Questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>At  pH = 7, what would be unique about the concentrations of the acid and base?</li>

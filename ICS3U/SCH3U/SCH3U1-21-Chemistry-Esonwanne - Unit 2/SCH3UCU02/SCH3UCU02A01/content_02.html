            <li>How does the author view a  “cow field” and a “garbage dump”?<br>

  Do you feel the same  way?  Why?</li>

            <li>What are the sources of methane and  what are the potential positive effects  on the sustainability of the environment?   Did you know about  this potential?</li>

            <li> What is “anaerobic digestion”?  And what does it involve?  Write the chemical word equation for  anaerobic digestion. What are the products of this chemical reaction and what  health and safety concerns are connected with the products of this  reaction?  What benefits does the author  share about this process?  Do you foresee  any problems concerning anaerobic digestion, for people who live in a  neighbourhood where this technology might be located?  </li>

            <li>Would you promote or discourage biogas  technology based on the anaerobic  reaction?  Provide reasons for your  decision.</li>

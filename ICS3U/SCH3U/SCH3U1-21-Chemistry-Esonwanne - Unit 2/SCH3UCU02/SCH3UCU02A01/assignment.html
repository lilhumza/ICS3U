</p>
<p>
As a  team, assess the effectiveness of some applications of chemical reactions that  are used to address social and environmental needs, issues or problems. For example, fluoridation of drinking water in Canada and the United States for dental hygiene has  become very controversial. Use such ideas&nbsp;or social issues in your  presentation.<br />
<br />
Your  report should be in the form of a presentation using Corel Presentation,  PowerPoint or similar presentation software approved by your teacher. 
</p>
<p>
Suggested  Framework/Issues:
</p>
<p>
Framework:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Include an introduction and a  conclusion in your presentation;.</li>
	<li>Use appropriate diagrams or  videos.</li>
	<li>Ensure you address environmental  degradation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Issues  and questions:
</p>
<ol type="1">
	<li>How can chemical reactions turn a  toxic chemical into one that is less toxic or non-toxic?</li>
	<li>How are chemical reactions used  to remediate areas affected by industrial accidents?</li>
	<li>What are risks and benefits of  industrial scrubbers' reactions to reduce pollution?</li>

<p>
Select a  career or sector in an industry that involves the use of chemical reactions. This  may include extracting, purifying or synthesizing industrial chemicals. These chemical  reactions may include gasses, organic and inorganic chemicals, or synthetic  materials used in hospitals, industries, or your home. Research the processes  involved in that industry. Analyze the risks and benefits of the chemical processes  that affect both the environment and people's health. 
</p>
<p>
Present  your findings and analysis in poster form.

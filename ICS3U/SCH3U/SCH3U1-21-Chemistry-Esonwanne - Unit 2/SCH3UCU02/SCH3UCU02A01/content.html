                <td><p><strong>Did  you know that baking soda will neutralize an acid?</strong></p>

                  <p>Baking  soda is made of sodium bicarbonate. It is a base and when a base reacts with an  acid, there is a chemical reaction. The type of chemical reaction is called  neutralization. This reaction can be expressed in two different ways:</p>

                  <ol>

                    <ol type="1"><li>Using words and symbols; and</li>

                    <li>Using formulas and symbols.

                      <br>

                    </li></ol>

                  </ol>

                  <p>When  reactions are represented by words and symbols, it is called a chemical word  equation. The chemical word equation when sodium bicarbonate reacts with  hydrochloric acid is as follows:</p>

                <p align="center">Sodium bicarbonate+hydrochloric acid  <img src="images/Arrow2_grn.gif" width="14" height="12"> sodium chloride +carbon dioxide + water</p>

                <p>A  balanced chemical equation represents the chemical reaction using formulas and  symbols. The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between sodium  bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid is as follows:</p>

                <p align="center">NaHCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s)  +   HCl(aq) <img src="images/Arrow2_grn.gif" width="14" height="12"> NaCl(aq)   +   CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)    +     H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l)</p>

                <p>The  sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid reaction helps to eliminate the  corrosive nature of the acid. If there was an acid spill, is baking soda a good  alternative?  If vinegar was spilled on  the kitchen counter, then your first inclination would be to pour some baking  soda on the vinegar. But, did you know that this reaction releases energy in  the form of heat?  </p>

                <p>If you  ever have an acid spill on your skin, water is the best way to wash the acid.  Acid is corrosive and water will dilute the acid and minimize the corrosive  nature of the acid. Baking soda will minimize the corrosive nature, but heat  will be produced and the potential for further burns are there. More harm than  good will be done. This is just one example where a chemical reaction might  have a positive effect in one way, and a negative effect in another. </p></td>

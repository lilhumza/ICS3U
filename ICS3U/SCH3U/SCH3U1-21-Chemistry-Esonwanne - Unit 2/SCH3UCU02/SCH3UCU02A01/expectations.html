            </p>

            <p><strong>SIV.01</strong>  demonstrate scientific investigation skills  (related to both inquiry and research) in the four areas of skills (initiating  and planning, performing and recording, analysing and interpreting, and  communicating);<br>

              <strong>CRV.01 </strong>analyze chemical  reactions and their applications, and assess their impact on society and the  environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific Expectations:<br>

              </strong> <br>

              <strong>SI1.01</strong> formulate relevant scientific questions about observed relationships, ideas,  problems, or issues, make informed predictions, and/or formulate educated  hypotheses to focus inquiries or research; <br>

              <strong>SI1.06</strong> compile  accurate data from laboratory and other sources, and organize and record the  data, using appropriate formats, including tables, flow charts, graphs, and/or  diagrams;<br>

              <strong>SI1.07</strong> select,  organize, and record relevant information on research topics from a variety of appropriate  sources, including electronic, print, and/or human sources, using suitable  formats and an accepted form of academic documentation;  <br>

              <strong>SI1.09</strong> analyse  the information gathered from research sources for logic, accuracy,  reliability, adequacy, and bias;<br>

              <strong>SI1.10</strong> draw  conclusions based on inquiry results and research findings, and justify their  conclusions with reference to scientific knowledge;<br>

              <strong>SI1.11</strong> communicate  ideas, plans, procedures, results, and conclusions orally, in writing, and/or  in electronic presentations, using appropriate language and a variety of  formats (e.g., data tables, laboratory reports, presentations, debates,  simulations, models); <br>

              <strong>CR1.01 </strong>assess the  effectiveness of some applications of chemical reactions that are used to  address social and environmental needs and problems;<br>

              <strong>CR1.02 </strong>analyze, on the  basis of research, chemical reactions used in various industrial processes  (e.g., pulp and paper production, mining, manufacturing of<br>

              biochemicals)  that have an impact on the health and safety of local populations.</p>

            <p><strong>Catholic Expectations:<br>

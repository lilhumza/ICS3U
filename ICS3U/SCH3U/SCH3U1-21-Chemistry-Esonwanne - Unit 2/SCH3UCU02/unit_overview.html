            Unit Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Chemicals and chemical reactions are synonymous with chemistry.  You will have an opportunity to spend time researching the application of reactions, and on the basis of their faith, critically analyze the chemical risks and benefits related to the sustainability of the environment.  The Chemical Reactions unit establishes a foundation for you to gain a better understanding and scope of the variety of different types of chemical reactions and their environmental implications.   The multimedia videoclips of different chemical reactions expands and provides you with opportunities for the preparation and completion of assignments, quizzes, interactive activities and a unit test.  This university level course unit is a starting point for subsequent material dealing with a quantitative approach to chemical reactions.</p>

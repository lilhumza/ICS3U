                <strong>Overall Expectations:</strong>

            </p>

            <p><strong>SIV.01</strong> demonstrate scientific investigation skills  (related to both inquiry and research) in the four areas of skills (initiating  and planning, performing and recording, analysing and interpreting, and  communicating);<br>

              <strong>CRV.02</strong> investigate  different types of chemical reactions;<br>

              <strong>CRV.03</strong> demonstrate an  understanding of the different types of chemical reactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific Expectations:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>SI1.12</strong> use  appropriate numeric, symbolic, and graphic modes of representation, and  appropriate units of measurement (e.g., SI and imperial units);<br>

                <strong>CR2.01 </strong>use appropriate  terminology related to chemical reactions, including but not limited to  neutralization, precipitate, acidic, and basic;<br>

                <strong>CR2.02 </strong>write balanced  chemical equations to represent synthesis, decomposition, single displacement,  double displacement, and combustion reactions, using the IUPAC nomenclature  system;<br>

                <strong>CR2.03 </strong>explain orally or in writing the relationship  between the atomic number<br>

              and the  mass number of an element, and the difference between isotopes and<br>

              radioisotopes  of an element;<br>

  <strong>CR2.06</strong> explain the chemical reaction that result in  the formation of acids and<br>

              bases  from metal oxides and non-metal oxides (e.g., calcium oxide reacts with<br>

              water to  produce a basic solution; carbon dioxide reacts with water to produce an<br>

              acidic  solution);<br>

  <strong>CR3.01 </strong>predict in team or individually the nature  of a bond.</p>

            <p><strong>Catholic Graduate Expectations:</strong><br>

                <br>

                <strong>CGE2b</strong> reads,  understands and uses written materials effectively;<br>

              <strong>CGE2d </strong>writes  and speaks fluently one or both of Canada’s official languages. </p>

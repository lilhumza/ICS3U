          <strong>Chemical Reactions</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>A chemical reaction is an event that  describes specific changes in substances. The components of a chemical reaction  can be subdivided and presented in the following organizational map:</p>
        <h4 align="center">

        <h4>
          <strong>Chemical Equations:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>              Chemical reactions are represented using  chemical equations. There are three basic components to a chemical equation: reactants,  products and the “arrow”. The general presentation is as follows:</p>
        <p align="center">
          <strong>Reactant(s)  <img height="12" width="14" src="images/Arrow_wh.gif" />   Product(s) </strong>
        </p>
        <p>The reactant side of the chemical equation  consists of the substance(s) that is/are undergoing a chemical change and are  positioned to the left side of the arrow. The product(s) is/are the new  substance(s) created in the chemical change and are located to the right of the  arrow. The arrow represents the division between the reactant(s) and the  product(s). </p>
        <h4>
          <strong>States of Matter in a Chemical Equation:</strong>
        </h4>
        <p>              In many cases, the states of matter of the  reactants and products in a chemical equation are important. Sometimes, the  states of matter are not included in the chemical equation for a particular  reason. In those cases, the states of matter are not needed in the context of  the information that the chemical equation is trying to convey i.e., stating  the substances undergoing the chemical change irrespective of their states. </p>
        <p>If the states of matter are used in the  chemical equation then they are indicated by a respective bracketed code  written to the right of the formula. They are as follows:</p>

              <div align="left">Another clue to indicate the state of  matter, especially for an element, is the term “elemental state”. If an element  is in its elemental state, then the code beside the symbol reflects the state  of the element at room temperature. As an example, copper is a solid at room  temperature and so the code for its symbol is Cu(s). Copper in liquid form is  not in its elemental state. The term “elemental state” only applies to  elements.</div>
